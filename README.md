A package containing functions for running [RHESSys](https://github.com/RHESSys/RHESSys) in R and processing output

The objective of this package is to produce R code that can be used to setup RHESSys, conduct calibrations and simulations, and process output. This package supports a long(er)-term goal of having experiments involving RHESSys be reproducible. #OpenScience
